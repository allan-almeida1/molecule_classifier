  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    This is a web application that uses a machine learning model (LGBM) to
    classify molecules as Activator, Inhibitor, or Inactive. Draw a molecule in
    the Ketcher app and click the <code>SEND</code> button to classify it. The
    model was trained on a dataset from the NCATS CYP3A4 assay, which contains
    5,239 molecules.
  </p>
  <p>
    The model was trained using the <code>LightGBM</code> library, which is a
    gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms.
  </p>
  <p>
    This web application was developed using Flask, a micro web framework for
    Python. It uses the
    <a href="https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/ketcher/">EPAM Ketcher</a>
    app to draw molecules and the <code>RDKit</code> library to convert the
    molecule SMILES string to a descriptor vector.
